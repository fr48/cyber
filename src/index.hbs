  <p class="body-text">Reusing passwords across multiple account-based services is common. According to a 2018 study of nearly 30 million users and their passwords, password reuse and modifications were common for 52% of users. The same study also found that 30% of the modified passwords and all the reused passwords can be cracked within just 10 guesses. This behavior puts users at risk of being victims of a breach replay attack. Once a threat actor gets hold of spilled credentials or credentials in the wild, they can try to execute a breach replay attack. In this attack, the actor tries out the same credentials on different service accounts to see if there is a match.</p>

  <p class="body-text">Related: 70 percent of responders on the Pew Research said they would consider doing business with a company over
    security and privacy concerns. That suggests that a company with a breach would find it harder to convince customers to come back, 
    except that doesn't seem to be the case. See how a <a href="trust-who.hbs">breach could impact a company's stock price.</a>
